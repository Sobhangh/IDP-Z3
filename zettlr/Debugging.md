Challenges:
* highly recursive → **use conditional breakpoints**
* complex data structure → improve visualisation →use **repr**, **logs**
* fix a problem results in a new one → seek to understand → **mermaid chart**, **logs**
* too many changes to main.py

Phases:
* document theory in math form
* simplify test case → sandbox.py
* identify root causes: 
    * loop(hypothesis → place conditional breakpoints occurring before observed problem → **manual fix**)
        * test hypothesis : change the cause manually and see it if fixes it ?

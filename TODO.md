for the paper:
    - infinitely quantified expression: eval by Z3 ? propagation ?  model ?
    - disequality atoms
    - maximize
    - explain, addAtom
        - propagated ? -> explain
        - use user entry in explain

NTH:
    - send on enter only
    - domain -> list box + ignore equality atoms with a constant
    - check syntax of int, real
    - garanteed order of appearance ?

    - convert fractions
    - relevance
    - inject found value into atom and simplify
    - implication semantics for definitions
    - simplify intervals
    - keep quantified expressions in full

Nice To Have
    - why multiple unnecessary calls to idp ?
    - p(real) should be possible

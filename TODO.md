parametric expansion:
    - equalities: on top of list, add "= ?" if missing (args !)
    - convert fractions, precedence: p => a & b.
    - relevance, minimize for atoms
    - inject found value into atom and simplify
    - implication semantics for definitions
    - simplify intervals
    - keep quantified expressions in full

Nice To Have
    - why multiple unnecessary calls to idp ?
    - IntsInRange: add restrictive
    - p(real) should be possible

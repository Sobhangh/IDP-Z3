entry of parameter:
    - show inconsistent numeric entry
    - explain, addAtom
        - propagated ? -> explain
        - use user entry in explain
    - send on enter only
    - domain -> list box + ignore equality atoms with a constant
    - check syntax of int, real
    - garanteed order of appearance ?

Other
    - convert fractions
    - relevance, minimize for atoms
    - inject found value into atom and simplify
    - implication semantics for definitions
    - simplify intervals
    - keep quantified expressions in full

Nice To Have
    - why multiple unnecessary calls to idp ?
    - IntsInRange: add restrictive
    - p(real) should be possible

Interactive Consultant
======================
The interactive consultant tool enables experts to digitize their knowledge of a specific problem domain.
With the resulting knowledge base, an online interface is automatically created that serves as a web tool supporting end users to find solutions for specific problems within that knowledge domain.

The interactive consultant is available `online <https://interactive-consultant.IDP-Z3.be/>`_, offering the possibility to everyone to specify a knowledge base using the IDP language and experiment with the resulting online configuration tool.
To quickstart your experience, the interactive consultant comes with two demo knowledge bases, available under the 'File' header:

* the 'Polygon' knowledge base, which specifies some common knowledge on the number of sides, their length and the angles for some common polygonal shapes; and
* the 'Registration' knowledge base, which models the Belgian federal law on property registration and the associated registration taxes.

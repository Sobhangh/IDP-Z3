Introduction
============

The IDP-Z3 tools implement a knowledge base system combining the `Microsoft Z3 solver <https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3>`_ and a grounder developed in-house, supporting the IDP language.
It is developed by the Knowledge Representation group at KU Leuven in Leuven, Belgium.

Projects
--------
The IDP-Z3 suite is currently deployed in the following projects:

* the `Interactive Consultant <interactive_consultant.html>`_, a tool enabling experts to digitize their knowledge of a specific problem domain, which results automatically in a web tool that supports end users to find solutions for specific problems.
* `DMN-IDP <https://dmn-idp.herokuapp.com/>`_, a user-friendly tool which combines the readability of the Decision Model and Notation (DMN) standard with the power of the IDP system through an interactive interface.

Get in touch?
-------------
The IDP-Z3 system is available for experimentation through its `online IDE <https://interactive-consultant.IDP-Z3.be/IDE>`_.
Support for the tool can be found in the online `documentation <https://docs.idp-z3.be/en/stable/>`_, including a guide on how to install the IDP-Z3 system for use offline.

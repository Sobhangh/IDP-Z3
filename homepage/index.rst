Introduction
============

The IDP-Z3 suite implements a knowledge base system in which knowledge is represented using the FO(.) language.
FO(.) is First Order logic extended with definitions, making it very expressive.
Its inference engine is developed by the Knowledge Representation group at KU Leuven in Leuven, Belgium.
It uses the `Microsoft Z3 solver <https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3>`_ as back-end.

Projects
--------
The IDP-Z3 suite is currently deployed in the following projects:

* the `Interactive Consultant <interactive_consultant.html>`_, a tool enabling experts to digitize their knowledge of a specific problem domain, which results automatically in a web tool that supports end users to find solutions for specific problems.
* `DMN-IDP <https://dmn-idp.herokuapp.com/>`_, a user-friendly tool which combines the readability of the Decision Model and Notation (DMN) standard with the power of the IDP system through an interactive interface.

Get in touch?
-------------
The IDP-Z3 system is available for experimentation through its `online IDE <https://interactive-consultant.IDP-Z3.be/IDE>`_.
Support for the tool can be found in the online `documentation <https://docs.idp-z3.be/en/stable/>`_, including a guide on how to install the IDP-Z3 system for use offline.

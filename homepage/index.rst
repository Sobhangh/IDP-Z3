Introduction
============

IDP-Z3 is a reasoning engine for knowledge represented using the FO(.) language.
FO(.) is First Order logic, with various extensions to make it more expressive: types, arithmetic, inductive definitions, aggregates, and intensional objects.
It uses the `Microsoft Z3 solver <https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3>`_ as back-end.

IDP-Z3 is developed by the Knowledge Representation group at KU Leuven in Leuven, Belgium, and made available under the [GNU LGPL v3 License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.txt)..

Projects
--------
The IDP-Z3 suite is currently deployed in the following projects:

* the `Interactive Consultant <interactive_consultant.html>`_, a tool enabling experts to encode their knowledge of a problem domain, and to automatically create an interactive web tool that helps end users find solutions for specific problems in that domain.
* `DMN-IDP <https://dmn-idp.herokuapp.com/>`_, a user-friendly tool which combines the readability of the Decision Model and Notation (DMN) standard with the power of the IDP system through an interactive interface.

- Definition:
     it is big if the perimeter > 5.
     it is big if length n°1 > 3.
- [Definition of triangle] the type is triangle if and only if the number of edges is 3.
- [Definition of rectangle] the type is quadrilateral if and only if the number of edges is 4.
- [There are as many vertices as there are sides] (the number of vertices is 3 if and only if the number of edges is 3) and (the number of vertices is 4 if and only if the number of edges is 4).
- [All triangles are convex] the number of edges is 3 is a sufficient condition for it is convex.
- [Definition of convex] it is convex if and only if (for every n in Side_Nr, it is true that angle n°n < 180).
- [Definition of equilateral] it is equilateral if and only if (for every n in Side_Nr, it is true that length n°n is length n°1 or length n°n is 0).
- [nr_of_sides() = 3 ⇒ subtype() = right_triangle ∨ subtype() = regular_triangle ∨ subtype() = irregular] the subtype is right_triangle or the subtype is regular_triangle or the subtype is irregular is a necessary condition for the number of edges is 3.
- [nr_of_sides() = 4 ⇒ subtype() = square ∨ subtype() = rectangle ∨ subtype() = irregular] the subtype is square or the subtype is rectangle or the subtype is irregular is a necessary condition for the number of edges is 4.
- [Squares and rectangles are quadrilaterals] the subtype is square or the subtype is rectangle is a sufficient condition for the number of edges is 4.
- [A regular triangle is an equilateral triangle] the subtype is regular_triangle if and only if the number of edges is 3 and it is equilateral.
- [A regular triangle is a triangle where all angles are 60°] the subtype is regular_triangle if and only if the number of edges is 3 and (for every n in Side_Nr, it is true that angle n°n is 60 or angle n°n is 0).
- [A right triangle is a triangle with a 90° angle] the subtype is right_triangle if and only if the number of edges is 3 and (there is a n in Side_Nr such that angle n°n is 90).
- [All angles are 90° in squares and rectangles] the number of edges is 4 and the subtype is not irregular if and only if (for every n in Side_Nr, it is true that angle n°n is 90 or angle n°n is 0).
- [In a rectangle, opposite Side_Nr have the same length, and adjacent sides have different lengths] the subtype is rectangle is a sufficient condition for length n°3 is length n°1 and length n°2 is length n°4 and length n°2 is not length n°1.
- [A square is an equilateral quadrilateral] the subtype is square is a sufficient condition for the number of edges is 4 and it is equilateral.

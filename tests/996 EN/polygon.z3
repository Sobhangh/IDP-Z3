- Definition:
     it is big if the perimeter > 5.
     it is big if length n°1 > 3.
- the type is triangle iff the number of edges is 3.
- the type is quadrilateral iff the number of edges is 4.
- (the number of vertices is 3 iff the number of edges is 3) and (the number of vertices is 4 iff the number of edges is 4).
- the number of edges is 3 is a sufficient condition for it is convex.
- it is convex iff (for every n ∈ Side_Nr, it is true that angle n°n < 180).
- it is equilateral iff (for every n ∈ Side_Nr, it is true that length n°n is length n°1 or length n°n is 0).
- the subtype is right_triangle or the subtype is regular_triangle or the subtype is irregular is a necessary condition for the number of edges is 3.
- the subtype is square or the subtype is rectangle or the subtype is irregular is a necessary condition for the number of edges is 4.
- the subtype is square or the subtype is rectangle is a sufficient condition for the number of edges is 4.
- the subtype is regular_triangle iff the number of edges is 3 and it is equilateral.
- the subtype is regular_triangle iff the number of edges is 3 and (for every n ∈ Side_Nr, it is true that angle n°n is 60 or angle n°n is 0).
- the subtype is right_triangle iff the number of edges is 3 and (there is a n ∈ Side_Nr such that angle n°n is 90).
- the number of edges is 4 and the subtype is not irregular iff (for every n ∈ Side_Nr, it is true that angle n°n is 90 or angle n°n is 0).
- the subtype is rectangle is a sufficient condition for length n°3 is length n°1 and length n°2 is length n°4 and length n°2 is not length n°1.
- the subtype is square is a sufficient condition for the number of edges is 4 and it is equilateral.
- the type is triangle is a sufficient condition for (length n°1 ≤ length n°2 + length n°3) and (length n°2 ≤ length n°3 + length n°1) and (length n°3 ≤ length n°1 + length n°2).
- the perimeter is the sum of length n°n for all n ∈ Side_Nr.
- the sum of angle n°n for all n ∈ Side_Nr is (the number of edges - 2) ⨯ 180.
- for every x ∈ Side_Nr, it is true that 0 ≤ length n°x.
- for every x ∈ Side_Nr, it is true that 0 ≤ angle n°x.
- for every x ∈ Side_Nr, it is true that angle n°x is not 180.
- for every n ∈ Side_Nr, it is true that angle n°n is 0 iff the number of vertices < n.
- for every n ∈ Side_Nr, it is true that length n°n is 0 iff the number of edges < n.

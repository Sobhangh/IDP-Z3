\section{Introduction}
IDP-Z3 is a collection of software components implementing the Knowledge Base paradigm using the IDP language and a Z3 SMT solver.

These components together enable the creation of these solutions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item the Interactive Consultant, which allow a knowledge expert to enter knowledge about a particular problem domain, and an end user to interactively find solutions for particular problem instances;
  \item (to be developed) a program with a command line interface to compute inferences on a knowledge base;
  \item (to be developed) a web-based Interactive Development Environment (IDE) to create Knowledge bases.
\end{itemize}

The source code of IDP-Z3 is publicly available under the GNU Affero General Public License.

\subsection{Installation}

IDP-Z3 is installed using the python package ecosystem, which supports Unix, Windows and MacOS.

\begin{itemize}
  \item install python 3.8, with pip3, making sure that python3 is in the PATH.
  \item optional: create a virtual environment
  \item use git to clone https://gitlab.com/krr/autoconfigz3 to a directory on your machine
  \item open a terminal (or command prompt) in that directory and run the following commands to launch the Interactive Consultant locally.
\end{itemize}
\begin{lstlisting}
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 main.py
\end{lstlisting}

In alphabtic order:

## **assignment**  
A question and its value, if any, annotated with: 
* information on how the value has been found (see Status),
* the symbol box in which it should be displayed in the Interactive Consultant,
* and a flag saying whether it is relevant in the model search.

## **.assignments**  
A dictionary of assignments that should be interpreted in a structure.
The key is the code of the formula.
Terms that begin with '_' are excluded.

## **.constraints**  
A statement in the theory block, or a type constraint resulting from a symbol declaration in the vocabulary.

## **.co_constraint**  
A constraint attached to a formula.  
Can represent the instantiation of a definition.

## **.def_constraints**  
A whole-domain constraint corresponding to a symbol definition. 

## **.questions**
A sub-formula of the theory that can be interpreted in a structure.
Includes variable-free terms, propositions, and quantified formulas occurring in the theory.

## **.status**  
An indicator of how an assignment value has been determined.
A.k.a, flag.

## **.subtences**
A *boolean* sub-formula of the theory that can be interpreted in a structure.
Includes variable-free boolean terms, propositions, and quantified formulas occurring in the theory.

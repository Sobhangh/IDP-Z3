Goal: allow separation of theory in 2: "environment" and "decision"

Options:
* add "block" property to constraints and definitions
* have a dictionary of vocabularies and theories

TODO:
- [x] use name symbol after "vocabulary"
- [x] add name symbol after "theory"
- [x] add a block property to constraints and definitions
- [x] use the theory property in has_decision()
- [x] remove environmental property of constraints and definitions
- [ ] remove has_decision(): NO: because used to determine type of assignment (e.g. Temp(Material))

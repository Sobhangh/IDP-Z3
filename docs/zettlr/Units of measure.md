Goals:
* enforce consistency of computations (do not add temperature and distance)
* allow expressions of physical laws independently of unit of measures (i.e. in a [system of measurement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_measurement))
* allow display of units of measure next to the quantity on screen
* allow the user to switch from km to miles, for example

Options:
* Physical variables should have a more precise type than real: Temperature, Weight, Distance, …  These types would be built-in.
* the display block should allow specifying the unit of measure of a type / a variable

Our aim is to develop a Knowedge Base system for:
* Education: to support teaching knowledge representation;
* Research: to support research in new language features and algorithms (with publication potential);
* Business: to support knowledge-rich business applications.

Here is our roadmap:

For Education:
* Training tool: a set of online exercises to teach logic and knowledge representation
* Syntax changes: improvements to the IDP3 syntax for consistency, readibility
* N-ary constructors: support for types like RGB(byte, byte, byte)
* Documentation: improve on-line reference of IDP-Z3 (e.g. more examples)
* Tutorials: to explain the key concepts behind the IDP-Z3 knowledge base system
* Inductive definitions: to support definitions that reference themselves
* Book: let's think big !

For Research:
* Structured language editor: to allow the entry of theories in a structured language
* Quantification over Symbols: to support macros and more concise theories
* Conversion to DMN: to create efficient decision tables for a goal from a theory
* Generative theories: to allow reasoning about situations with an unknown number of objects
* Causal explanations: use causality to create more natural explanations
* Refinements: reason with theories with various levels of precision

For Business:
* GUI improvements in the Interactive Consultant
* DMN editor: allow entry of theories in the form of DMN tables
* Partial functions: ensure that models of a theory use functions within their domains
* Units of measure: support reasoning with units of measure
* Pareto optimisation: support more sophisticated forms of optimisation
* Non-linear arithmetic: support non-linear constraints

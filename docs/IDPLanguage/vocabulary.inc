.. _vocabulary:

Vocabulary
----------

.. code::

    vocabulary V {
        // here comes the vocabulary named V
    }

The *vocabulary* block specifies the types, predicates, functions and variables used to describe the problem domain.
If the name is omitted, the vocabulary is named V.

Each declaration goes on a new line (or are space separated).
Symbols begins with a word character excluding digits, followed by word characters.
Word characters include alphabetic characters, digits, ``_``, and unicode characters that can occur in words.
Symbols can also be string literals delimited by ``'``, e.g., ``'blue planet'``.

Types
+++++

IDP-Z3 supports built-in and custom types.

The built-in types are:  ``ùîπ``, ``‚Ñ§``, ``‚Ñù``, ``Date``, and ``Concept[signature]`` (where ``signature`` is any type signature, e.g. ``()->Bool``).
The equivalent ASCII symbols are ``Bool``, ``Int``, and ``Real``.

The type ``Concept[signature]`` has one constructor for each symbol (i.e., function, predicate or constant) declared in the vocabulary with that signature.
The constructors are the names of the symbol, prefixed with `````.

Custom types are declared using the keyword ``type``, e.g., ``type color``.
Their name should be singular and capitalized, by convention.

Their extension can be defined in a structure_, or directly in the vocabulary, by specifying:

* a list of (ranges of) numeric literals, e.g., ``type someNumbers := {0,1,2}`` or ``type byte := {0..255}``

* a list of (ranges of) dates, e.g., ``type dates := {#2021-01-01, #2022-01-01}`` or ``type dates := {#2021-01-01 .. #2022-01-01}``

* a list of nullary constructors, e.g., ``type Color := {Red, Blue, Green}``

* a list of n-ary constructors; in that case, the enumeration must be preceded by ``constructed from``, e.g., ``type Color2 := constructed from {Red, Blue, Green, RGB(R: Byte, G: Byte, B: Byte)}``

In the above example, the constructors of ```Color`` are : ``Red``, ``Blue``, ``Green``.

The constructors of ```Color2`` are : ``Red``, ``Blue``, ``Green`` and ``RGB``.
Each constructor have an associated function (e.g., ``is_Red``, or ``is_RGB``) to test if a Color2 term was created with that constructor.
The ``RGB`` constructor takes 3 arguments of type ``Byte``.
``R``, ``G`` and ``B`` are accessor functions: when given a Color2 term constructed with RGB, they return the associated Byte.
(When given a Color2 not constructed with RGB, they may raise an error)


.. _function:
.. index:: function

Functions
+++++++++

The functions with name ``myFunc1``, ``myFunc2``, input domains ``p1``, ``p2``, ``p3`` and output range ``p``, are declared by:

.. code::

    myFunc1, myFunc2 : p1 ‚®Ø p2 ‚®Ø p3 ‚Üí p

Their name should not start with a capital letter, by convention.
The ASCII equivalent of ``‚®Ø`` is ``*``, and of ``‚Üí`` is ``->``.

The domains and ranges must be one of the following:

* a previously-declared type
* a previously-declared unary predicate
* ``Concept[<signature>]`` to denote the set of concepts with a particular signature, e.g. ``Concept[Person -> Bool]``.

The functions must be total over their domain.

The type of each argument can be directly read in the signature when it is a type or set of concepts,
or obtained by looking up the type of the argument of the unary predicate otherwise.


.. _predicate:
.. index:: predicate

Predicates
++++++++++

A predicate is a function whose range is ``Bool``.

A unary predicate is always interpreted as a subset of a type.


.. _variable declaration:
.. index:: variable declaration

Variable Declarations
+++++++++++++++++++++

A variable may be declared with its type:

.. code::

    var x ‚àà T

This is convenient for quantifications:
the type of the variable may be omitted in quantifications:
its declared type will be assumed.

A quantification cannot use a declared variable to quantify over another type than the declared one.

The variables ``x1, x2, ...`` are implicitly declared with the same type as ``x``.
(the variable in the declaration may not have a digital suffix)


.. _built-in functions:

Built-in functions
++++++++++++++++++

The following functions are built-in:

* ``abs: Int ‚Üí Int`` (or ``abs: Float ‚Üí Float``) yields the absolute value of an integer (or float) expression;


.. _constant:
.. index:: constant, proposition

Propositions and Constants
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A proposition is a predicate of arity 0; a constant is a function of arity 0.

.. code::

    MyProposition : () ‚Üí ùîπ
    MyConstant: () ‚Üí Int


.. _extern:
.. index:: include vocabulary

Include another vocabulary
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A vocabulary W may include a previously defined vocabulary V:

.. code::

    vocabulary W {
        import V
        // here comes the vocabulary named W
    }


.. _Vannotations:
.. index:: annotation (vocabulary)

Symbol annotations
++++++++++++++++++

To improve the display of functions and predicates in the :ref:`Interactive Consultant <Consultant>`,
their declaration in the vocabulary can be annotated with their intended meaning, a short comment, or a long comment.
These annotations are enclosed in ``[`` and ``]``, and come before the symbol declaration.

.. _meaning:
.. index:: intended meaning

Intended meaning
    ``[this is a text]`` specifies the intended meaning of the symbol.
    This text is shown in the header of the symbol's box.

Short info
    ``[short:this is a short comment]`` specifies the short comment of the symbol.
    This comment is shown when the mouse is over the info icon in the header of the symbol's box.

Long info
    ``[long:this is a long comment]`` specifies the long comment of the symbol.
    This comment is shown when the user clicks the info icon in the header of the symbol's box.

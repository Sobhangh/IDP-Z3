Interactive Consultant
======================

The Interactive Consultant tool enables experts to digitize their knowledge of a specific problem domain.
With the resulting knowledge base, an online interface is automatically created that serves as a web tool supporting end users to find solutions for specific problems within that knowledge domain.

The tool uses IDP-Z3 as input. However, there are some specific changes and additions when using IDP-Z3 in the Interactive Consultant, which are explained further in this chapter.
